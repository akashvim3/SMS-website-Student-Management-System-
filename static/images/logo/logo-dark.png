This is a placeholder for the PNG version of the logo-dark.

In a real-world scenario, you would:
1. Convert the SVG to PNG using a tool like Inkscape, SVGOMG, or a dedicated conversion service
2. Save the PNG with transparency at the appropriate resolution (200x60 pixels)
3. Ensure the colors match exactly with the SVG version

Note: Since this is a text file and not an actual binary PNG, this file should be replaced with a proper PNG image file when available.
